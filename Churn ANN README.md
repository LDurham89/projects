Hi
The Churn ANN project takes data on digital media customers and builds a model to predict if customers will churn.

To do the this, the code does the following:

- Read in and wrangle data
- Use visualisationa and summary statistics to identify relationships in the data and engineers variables for analysis
- Identifies and addresses data leakage
- Scales data
- Creates train and test data sets
- Creates an Artifical Neural Network to create a model that can predict if customers will churn
- Evaluates the model
